# Gitrieve a Github API App

## Description
This is a Github API that uses [Tentacat](https://hexdocs.pm/tentacat/readme.html) to search and retrieve an organization's public repositories. This app was written in Elixir, Phoenix, and PostgresSQL.



To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
